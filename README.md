# UFOs

### Overview of the analysis
This analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Dana's webpage and dynamic table has been updated to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape

### Results
The webpage has been constructed showing the different layers using HTML and Javascript. The image below shows the outlook of the webpage when opened

Moving further into the webpage are *Filter panes* on the left to help users set precise data parameters on their search and on the right *Outcome panes* to give result to the inputed search. The filter panes have 5 unique channels to look over from; the date, city, state, country and shape. The user writes in the pursuit bar, and then HTML page will create the sightings for the hunt rules entered. Simultaneously, the result populates to additional enteries as inputed. Below is an image of two parameters chosen, the State to be 'tx' and shape to be 'light'

As seen, two results are revealed along side its other information useful to the user.

### Summary

From the new webpage design, uppercase/mixedcases and full state/country names will not project the search request by the user. For further development, I recommend the coding to be adjust to accept such search texts. i.e. Maryland, South Carolina, and also suggestion on populating result columns parameters to give the user the choice on which column header he/she would want to display the result on to avoid too much unrequired information.
